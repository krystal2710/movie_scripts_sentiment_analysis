# Sentiment Scores of Movie Scripts and <br> Their Performance on Comedy Classification Task

The project first aims at getting the information of what sentiments movies imply from the movie scripts to a decent level of accuracy. It then uses these sentiment scores for comedy classification task in comparison with using TF-IDF scores extracted from the movie scripts. The goal is to see whether sentiment scores help with better classifying comedy and reducing space and time complexity thanks to a smaller training dataset (sentiment scores) compared to the previous larger training dataset (TF-IDF scores).
