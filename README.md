# Introduction to Cultural Analytics, Individual Research Project

## Final Draft with Associated Code and Data

The purpose of the Individual Research Project assignment is to synthesize elements of cultural analytics domain knowledge and methods into an original project. As such, you are expected to articulate a research question related to the subject of cultural analytics, design a computational approach to your question, identify and/or develop a dataset for your analysis, execute a central computation, and write a paper that describes your work.

If everything has gone according to plan, the scaffolding assignments have enabled you to make significant progress on developing your research question, curating your data, and implementing the computational/quantitative aspect of your final project. The focus of the final submission should be refining your approach and communicating your results through writing and visual elements. 

To make this process as transparent as possible, you have been asked to use the IMRAD template, which is typical for research papers in STEM fields and the social sciences. As a result, your submission should include the following sections:

## 1. Introduction

2-3 paragraphs (about 500 words). Should include a clear articulation of your research question. It should include any background information a reader might need to understand your work, including at least one or two citations to some prior research done in your chosen domain area. (Your introduction can be a revision/expansion of the intro you wrote for the initial findings assignment.)

## 2. Methods and Data

5-6 paragraphs (about 1,000 words); 1-2 visuals. This section typically includes:

- 2-3 paragraphs describing your dataset (including, often, a table with your dependent variable, your independent variables, data types for all columns, number of observations, etc.). Most importantly, it should include all the important information a reader would need to know about your dataset in order to understand how it fits into the project.

- 2-3 paragraphs describing your methods, including what your central computation is, how your central computation relates to your research question, and a description of why the focal method(s) are appropriate for the research question and your dataset.

Here it is also typical to mention validation techniques that will be employed, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the methods you are using.

## 3. Results

4-5 paragraphs (about 900 words). 2-3 visuals, including at least one chart and one table of results. As with the initial findings assignment, this section should report the results of your central computation, including model performance, validations, measures of statistical significance, coefficients, etc. Any results demonstrated with tables and charts should be discuss in more detail in the narrative. As with the introduction, this section can be a revision/expansion of the version you wrote for the initial findings assignment. However, unlike the initial findings version, these results should not be tentative. They should be fully validated, and as well vetted and as reliable as possible. 

## 4. Analysis/Discussion 

4-5 paragraphs (about 900 words). Tables and charts encouraged but not required. In the initial results assignment, you were asked to discuss tentative results but not engage in much interpretation. In this new section, you should focus on interpretation. What do your results suggest about  your original research question? You may also wish to revise/expand the "next steps" aspect of the initial results assignment in this section.

## 5. References 

Please use APA format for all works cited. Include a citation for your central dataset if you have taken it from somewhere online, or developed it from a larger online source such as Spotify or Twitter.


__Note:__ For this assignment, you are expected to fork the starter repository and create a central markdown file for your research project paper. You can name that file whatever you like, but it should be unmistakably clear when looking at your repo which file represents your final work. To remove any ambiguity, you may wish to name that file using keywords from your paper title, and/or using your last name, as in `Lavin-Examining-Bias-in-Book-Reviews.md` or `LavinFinalSubmission.md`. Your final submission should also include:

- all data for your project 

- all code that executes the central computation from your project, preferably in a Jupyter Notebook file

- a folder of all images used in your paper, such that all visuals will display properly in your markdown file.

Finally, as with all other assignments this semester, make sure you create a `student` branch for this repo and save all completed work to that branch before doing your pull request. 

## Assignment Rubric 

| Item | Description |
|---|---|
| Assignment Process: |	All materials are turned in on time and in the right place. Assignment directions are followed. Required components are all present and submitted on time. Includes makeing a `student` branch on Github and creating a valid pull request.|
| Attention to Detail: | The project is well organized, flows logically, and follows the all formatting guidelines, including attention to proofreading, proper citations, and language that is appropriate to a well-informed, non-technical reader.|
| Research Question and Research Design: | The project has a focused and well-defined research question that can be addressed with computational, data-driven analysis. The focal data set and method(s) are appropriate for the research question.|
| Data, Visuals, and Code: | The central dataset is fully described, properly sourced, and presented in appropriate ways. Visuals (tables, charts, graphs) are used effectively to describe multiple aspects of the research project (data, methods, or results). The submission provides sufficient details and/or points to supplementary materials that make the research reproducible by a technical reader (i.e, detailed footnotes, appendices, GitHub, code, etc.)|
| Data Analysis Methods: | The method(s) used to test the research question is/are justified, validated, and applied appropriately; the student appropriately describes the strengths and weaknesses of the methods used; outside sources are used to justify how the methods are used and interpreted.|
| Reporting and Interpretation of Results: | The results are interpreted correctly and clearly address the research question; the project discusses its limitations, the extent to which it can be generalized, and expansion to further research.|
